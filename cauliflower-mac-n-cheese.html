        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring 
                occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes.
                 Drain.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water 
                to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. 
                Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, 5 to 6 minutes. 
                Place cauliflower in a blender or food processor; blend until 
                smooth.</li>
            <li>Coat a large saucepan with non-stick cooking spray; place 
                over medium heat. Add oil and flour; cook, stirring constantly,
                 until a thick paste forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Add milk; cook
                  and stir until mixture thickens, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix cauliflower, Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, salt, and pepper
                 into milk mixture; stir until sauce is smooth. Fold macaroni 
                 into sauce.</li>
        </ol>
