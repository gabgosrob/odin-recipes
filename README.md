# Odin Recipes

HTML website project for The Odin Project.

## Skills Learned

### HTML
This project has taught me basic HTML syntax and how to make content appear on a browser loading an HTML file using headings, paragraphs, lists, images and hyperlinks. 

### CSS
I also implemented basic CSS for the website, which taught me how selectors, classes and ids work along with how to derive their specificity. Additionally, I have become comfortable using common properties for text items and images.

### File Structure
Finally, I learned the basic structure of the files composing a website within its directory and how to refer to these files using either absolute or relative links.
