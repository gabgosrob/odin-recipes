# Odin Recipes

HTML website project for The Odin Project.

## Skills Learned

This project has taught me basic HTML syntax and how to make content appear on a browser loading an HTML file using headings, paragraphs, lists, images and hyperlinks. I also learned the basic structure of the files composing a website within its directory and how to refer to these files using either absolute or relative links.
